## Potential Root Causes & Solutions
### I. DDOS Attack

- Symptoms:
    - Sudden spike in memory usage
    - Unusual traffic patterns
    - Large number of concurrent connections
    - High CPU usage alongside memory issues
    - Unusual geographic traffic sources

- Solution:
```
# Block malicious IP addresses
iptables -A INPUT -s <malicious_ip> -j DROP
```

### II. Memory leak in NGINX

- Symptoms:
  - Gradually increasing memory usage
  - No memory release after traffic drops

- Solution:
```
# Graceful NGINX reload
nginx -s reload

# If needed, restart NGINX
systemctl restart nginx
```

### III. Misconfigured NGINX Worker Processes

- Symptoms:
  - Too many worker processes
  - Worker connections too high

- Solution:
```
# Edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
worker_processes auto;  # Or set to CPU core count
worker_connections 1024;  # Adjust based on needs
```

### IV. Memory-Intensive NGINX Modules

- Symptoms:
  - Specific modules using excessive memory
  - Large buffer settings

- Solution:
```
  # Optimize buffer settings
  client_body_buffer_size 16k;
  client_max_body_size 8m;
  client_header_buffer_size 1k;
```

### V. System-Level Memory Issues

- Symptoms:
  - System services misbehaving

- Solution:
```
# Clean system caches
sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

# Review and adjust system limits
vim /etc/security/limits.conf
```
